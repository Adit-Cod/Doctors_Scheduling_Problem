Thought Process
***************

1. Setup the clinic and doctors before letting patients come in. This takes place in the main thread. 
2. The timer is the first thing to start. As per logical operation. Note: Time is approximated keeping worst case in mind.  
3. Once the threads have been created, doctor sleeps (sleep has been mimicked) until there is a patient available in the waiting room. if there is no one, just decrement the counter and wait for the day to complete.

NOTE: The design is intended to have doctor poll for patients from the waiting room. 

4. Patient Threads have been created at this point. Insert patient into the waiting room ( Binary Heap ) and 
exit the thread once all the attributes of the patient have been populated. 

NOTE: One exception to insertion would be in case of a VIP patient. If there is a VIP coming in and he figures there is a patient with the doctor with lower priority; he pulls him out and sets a preemption action in play.
    In addition, if the patient coming in is of higher priority than the last person in the waiting room. There is a swap. The patient with lower priority is put into cafe while higher is in the last position of waiting room 

5. Doctors continue to pick patients from the prioritized queue. Once addressed, puts into file system in order of execution/ completion (in case of multiple doc scenario).

6. Once patient count for the day has been reaced or the timer has been down to 0. Doctors will exit. 

7. Close file is called for the day. Patient records have been generated in text file within the same file system. 

8. Application exits.

Assumptions

1. Number of patients, Doctors, waiting room capacity, time to execute.
